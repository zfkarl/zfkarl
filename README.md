### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m a CSE PhD student at [CUHK](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Pheng-Ann Heng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OFdytjoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
- My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Models, Multimodal AI, and their applications in scientific problems.
